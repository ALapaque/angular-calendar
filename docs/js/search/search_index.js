If you were relying on it being transparent before you will need to override with css. To migrate you can add this to your global CSS:\n\n.cal-month-view, .cal-week-view, .cal-day-view {\n  background-color: initial;\n}\n\nIf overriding the main week view template, replace \n```\n\nngFor=\"let eventRow of view.allDayEventRows; trackBy:trackByIndex\"\nwith\n\nngFor=\"let eventRow of view.allDayEventRows; trackBy:trackById\"\n```\n\nIf extending the CalendarMonthViewComponent you must add [ngStyle]=\"{ backgroundColor: day.backgroundColor }\" to the mwl-calendar-month-cell component.\n\n\n\n0.26.11 (2019-03-17)\nBug Fixes\n\nweek-view: dont

To migrate:\n\nInstall date-fns with npm:\nnpm i date-fns\nAdd the date-fns calendar-utils adapter to the first argument of the CalendarModule.forRoot method:\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { CalendarModule, DateAdapter } from 'angular-calendar';\nimport { adapterFactory } from 'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns';\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    CalendarModule.forRoot({\n      provide: DateAdapter,\n      useFactory: adapterFactory\n    })\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}\n```\nFor system.js users you will also need to add the following entries to your systemjs config:\n'calendar-utils': 'npm:calendar-utils/bundles/calendar-utils.umd.js',\n'calendar-utils/date-adapters/date-fns': 'npm:calendar-utils/date-adapters/date-fns/index.js',\n'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns': 'npm:angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns/index.js'\n* week-view: the format of the week view title has changed from Week d of yyyy to MMM d - MMM d, yyyy. You can override this by using a custom date formatter.\n* day-view: the allDayEventTemplate option was removed from the day view. To migrate use the eventTemplate input and check if dayEvent.event.allDay is set in the template\n* Week view events will now appear on the bottom time grid. To restore the old behaviour you can set allDay: true on the event to make it appear at the top. \nPeople extending the CalendarWeekViewComponent will probably have to adjust their child component as the template and internal component api has changed significantly.\n* month-view: If using a custom openDayEventsTemplate for the month view you must now wrap your template with:\n```\n\n```\n\nand then you must add the collapse animation to the component that contains the open day events :\n```\nimport { collapseAnimation } from 'angular-calendar';\n// add this to your component metadata\nanimations: [collapseAnimation]\n```\n* tooltip: all tooltips now default to auto positioning, you can use the tooltipPlacement input on all components to override this behaviour though\n* event-clicked: eventClicked now fires whenever the event container instead of the event title is clicked\n* day-view: previously events with no end date that were resized would emit an empty end time, now they will emit a sensible default new end date\n* resizable: only one event at a time can now be resized on the day or week views\n* week-view: if you were extending the week view component then the internal API has changed slightly and you may need to adjust your app\n* month-view: Custom template users will now need to add a \"dragActiveClass='cal-drag-active'\" anywhere they use an mwlDraggable directive\nIf using the mwlDraggable directive anywhere else in your app you will need to apply pointer-events: none to the element yourself when it's being dragged. This can be done with the dragActiveClass option\n* day-view: if you were extending the day view component then the internal API has changed slightly and you may need to adjust your app\n* deep module imports angular-calendar/modules/{common,month,week,day} are no longer supported as the package is now treeshakable. To migrate, adjust your imports to be from angular-calendar directly\n* moment: the moment weekViewColumnSubHeader format has changed for consistency with the other date formatters\n* there were some minor breaking changes in the drag and drop library that might affect your app if you were using it outside of the calendar.

The successor of angular-bootstrap-calendar.\nGetting started\nFirst install through npm:\nbash\nnpm install --save angular-calendar date-fns\nNext include the CSS file in the global (not component scoped) styles of your app:\n/* angular-cli file: src/styles.css */\n@import \"../node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css\";\nFinally import the calendar module into your apps module:\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { CalendarModule, DateAdapter } from 'angular-calendar';\nimport { adapterFactory } from 'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns';\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    CalendarModule.forRoot({\n      provide: DateAdapter,\n      useFactory: adapterFactory\n    })\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}\n```\nIn order to allow the most flexibility for all users there is a substantial amount of boilerplate required to get up and running. Please see the demos list for a series of comprehensive examples of how to use this library within your application.\nOnce you are up and running, to access a full list of options for each component, the individual APIs are documented here: mwl-calendar-month-view, mwl-calendar-week-view and mwl-calendar-day-view.\nIf you would like a one on one consulation with me where I can show you the best way to integrate and customise this calendar within your application, then you can get this by becoming a Platinum Sponsor on Patreon.\nModule bundlers\nYou can find quick start examples for all common module bundlers in the build-tool-examples folder.\nDocumentation\nTo see all available API options, take a look at the auto generated documentation. You may find it helpful to view the examples on the demo page.\nBreaking changes\nWhere possible this library will strictly adhere to semver and only introduce API breaking changes in 0.x releases or new major versions post 1.0. The only exception to this is if you are using custom templates or extending the base components to add additional functionality, whereby critical bug fixes may introduce breakages as the internal API changes.\nFAQ\nIs this library AoT and universal compatible?\nYes.\nWhat major versions of angular does this library support?\n| Angular major  | Last supported angular-calendar version                                |\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 6.x and higher | latest version                                                         |\n| 5.x            | 0.24.1 |\n| 4.x            | 0.22.3 |\n| 2.x            | 0.9.1   |\nHow do I use this with my favourite module bundler?\nSee the examples list.\nNo styles are appearing?\nNo component styles are included with each component to make it easier to override them (otherwise you’d have to use !important on every rule that you customised). Thus you need to import the CSS file separately from node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css.\nHow come there are so many dependencies?\nWhen building the calendar some parts were found to be reusable so they were split out into their own modules. Only the bare minimum that is required is included with the calendar, there is no extra code than if there were no dependencies. date-fns especially only imports directly the functions it needs and not the entire library.\nThe month, week or day view doesn’t meet my project requirements, but the other views do.\nBuild your own component to replace that view, and use it in place of the one this library provides. It’s impossible to provide a calendar component that meets everyones use cases, hopefully though at least some of the day / week / month view components provided can be customised with the calendars API enough to be of some use to most projects.\nHow come there’s no year view like the ng1 version?\nAs there are so many events to show on each month, it doesn’t provide a lot of value and is just an extra burden to maintain. There is nothing to stop someone from building a new lib like angular-calendar-year-view though ;)\nDoes this calendar work with mobile?\nThis library is not optimised for mobile. Due to the complex nature of a calendar component, it is non trivial to build a calendar that has a great UX on both desktop and mobile. It is recommended to build your own calendar component for mobile that has a dedicated UX. You may be able to get some degree of mobile support by setting some custom CSS rules for smaller screens, including hammerjs and using a custom hammerjs config to allow scrolling on clickable elements.\nHow do I use a custom template?\nAll parts of this calendar can be customised via the use of an ng-template. The recipe for applying one is as follows:\n\nFind the template you would like to customise for the month, week or day view component. You can find all available custom templates by reading the documentation for each component. For this example we will pick the cellTemplate from the month view.\nNext find the corresponding child component that will render the template by viewing the source. For our example of the month view cell it is this component\nNow copy the template source for your chosen template into your own component and modify as your see fit.\nFinally pass the template to the components input: \nYou can see an e2e working example of this here\n\nWhat is the browser compatibility?\nAll browsers supported by angular, apart from IE9 as it doesn't support flexbox.\nDoes this library require bootstrap?\nNo! While the demo site uses bootstrap, it isn't a requirement of this library. The styling is designed to adapt to whatever global styling your app has.\nAngular 1 version\nhttps://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-bootstrap-calendar\nDevelopment\nPrepare your environment\n\nInstall Node.js and NPM (should come with)\nInstall local dev dependencies: npm install while current directory is this repo\n\nDevelopment server\nRun npm start to start a development server on port 8000 with auto reload + tests.\nTesting\nRun npm test to run tests once or npm run test:watch to continually run tests.\nRelease\n\nBump the version in package.json (once the module hits 1.0 this will become automatic)\n\nbash\nnpm run release\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2018 Matt Lewis\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
