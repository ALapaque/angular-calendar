There are 3 implementations available, the `CalendarAngularDateFormatter` (default) which uses the angular date pipe to format dates, the `CalendarNativeDateFormatter` which will use the Intl API to format dates, or there is the `CalendarMomentDateFormatter` which uses moment.\n *\n * If you wish, you may override any of the defaults via angulars DI. For example:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * import { CalendarDateFormatter, DateFormatterParams } from 'angular-calendar';\n * import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';\n *\n * class CustomDateFormatter extends CalendarDateFormatter {\n *\n *   public monthViewColumnHeader({date, locale}: DateFormatterParams): string {\n *     return new DatePipe(locale).transform(date, 'EEE', locale); // use short week days\n *   }\n *\n * }\n *\n * // in your component that uses the calendar\n * providers: [{\n *   provide: CalendarDateFormatter,\n *   useClass: CustomDateFormatter\n * }]\n * ```\n */\nexport class CalendarDateFormatter extends CalendarAngularDateFormatter {}\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"pipes/CalendarDatePipe.html":{"url":"pipes/CalendarDatePipe.html","title":"pipe - CalendarDatePipe","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Pipes\n  CalendarDatePipe\n\n\n\n    \n        Info\n    \n\n\n    \n        Source\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n            File\n        \n        \n            src/modules/common/calendar-date.pipe.ts\n        \n\n            \n                Description\n            \n            \n                This pipe is primarily for rendering the current view title.

Hire me! &#x1F468;‍&#x1F4BB;\nDemo\nhttps://mattlewis92.github.io/angular-calendar/\nTable of contents\n\nAbout\nGetting started\nDocumentation\nBreaking changes\nFAQ\nAngular 1 version\nDevelopment\nLicense\n\nAbout\nA calendar component for Angular 6.0+ that can display events on a month, week or day view. The successor of angular-bootstrap-calendar.\nGetting started\nFirst install through npm:\nnpm install --save angular-calendarNext include the CSS file in the global (not component scoped) styles of your app:\n/* angular-cli file: src/styles.css */\n@import \"../node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css\";Finally import the calendar module into your apps module:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { CalendarModule } from 'angular-calendar';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [BrowserAnimationsModule, CalendarModule.forRoot()]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}In order to allow the most flexibility for all users there is a substantial amount of boilerplate required to get up and running. Please see the demos list for a series of comprehensive examples of how to use this library within your application.\nOnce you are up and running, to access a full list of options for each component, the individual APIs are documented here: mwl-calendar-month-view, mwl-calendar-week-view and mwl-calendar-day-view.\nModule bundlers\nYou can find quick start examples for all common module bundlers in the build-tool-examples folder.\nDocumentation\nTo see all available API options, take a look at the auto generated documentation. You may find it helpful to view the examples on the demo page.\nBreaking changes\nWhere possible this library will strictly adhere to semver and only introduce API breaking changes in 0.x releases or new major versions post 1.0. The only exception to this is if you are using custom templates or extending the base components to add additional functionality, whereby critical bug fixes may introduce breakages as the internal API changes.\nFAQ\nIs this library AoT and universal compatible?\nYes.\nDoes this library work with angular 2.x?\nThe last version of this library that supports 2.x is 0.9.1.\nDoes this library work with angular 4.x?\nThe last version of this library that supports 4.x is 0.22.3.\nDoes this library work with angular 5.x?\nThe last version of this library that supports 5.x is 0.24.1.\nHow do I use this with my favourite module bundler?\nSee the examples list.\nNo styles are appearing?\nNo component styles are included with each component to make it easier to override them (otherwise you’d have to use !important on every rule that you customised). Thus you need to import the CSS file separately from node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css.\nHow come there are so many dependencies?\nWhen building the calendar some parts were found to be reusable so they were split out into their own modules. Only the bare minimum that is required is included with the calendar, there is no extra code than if there were no dependencies. date-fns especially only imports directly the functions it needs and not the entire library.\nThe month, week or day view doesn’t meet my project requirements, but the other views do.\nBuild your own component to replace that view, and use it in place of the one this library provides. It’s impossible to provide a calendar component that meets everyones use cases, hopefully though at least some of the day / week / month view components provided can be customised with the calendars API enough to be of some use to most projects.\nHow come there’s no year view like the ng1 version?\nAs there are so many events to show on each month, it doesn’t provide a lot of value and is just an extra burden to maintain. There is nothing to stop someone from building a new lib like angular-calendar-year-view though ;)\nDoes this calendar work with mobile?\nThis library is not optimised for mobile. Due to the complex nature of a calendar component, it is non trivial to build a calendar that has a great UX on both desktop and mobile. It is recommended to build your own calendar component for mobile that has a dedicated UX. You may be able to get some degree of mobile support by setting some custom CSS rules for smaller screens and including hammerjs but your mileage may vary.\nHow do I use a custom template?\nAll parts of this calendar can be customised via the use of an ng-template. The recipe for applying one is as follows:\n\nFind the template you would like to customise for the month, week or day view component. You can find all available custom templates by reading the documentation for each component. For this example we will pick the cellTemplate from the month view.\nNext find the corresponding child component that will render the template by viewing the source. For our example of the month view cell it is this component\nNow copy the template source for your chosen template into your own component and modify as your see fit.\nFinally pass the template to the components input: \nYou can see an e2e working example of this here\n\nWhat is the browser compatibility?\nAll browsers supported by angular, apart from IE9 as it doesn't support flexbox.\nAngular 1 version\nhttps://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-bootstrap-calendar\nDevelopment\nPrepare your environment\n\nInstall Node.js and NPM (should come with)\nInstall local dev dependencies: npm install while current directory is this repo\n\nDevelopment server\nRun npm start to start a development server on port 8000 with auto reload + tests.\nTesting\nRun npm test to run tests once or npm run test:watch to continually run tests.\nRelease\n\nBump the version in package.json (once the module hits 1.0 this will become automatic)\n\nnpm run releaseLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2016 Matt Lewis\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
