To migrate:\n\nInstall date-fns with npm:\nnpm i date-fnsAdd the date-fns calendar-utils adapter to the first argument of the CalendarModule.forRoot method:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { CalendarModule, DateAdapter } from 'angular-calendar';\nimport { adapterFactory } from 'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    CalendarModule.forRoot({\n      provide: DateAdapter,\n      useFactory: adapterFactory\n    })\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}For system.js users you will also need to add the following entries to your systemjs config:\n'calendar-utils': 'npm:calendar-utils/bundles/calendar-utils.umd.js',\n'calendar-utils/date-adapters/date-fns': 'npm:calendar-utils/date-adapters/date-fns/index.js',\n'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns': 'npm:angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns/index.js'\nweek-view: the format of the week view title has changed from Week d of yyyy to MMM d - MMM d, yyyy. You can override this by using a custom date formatter.\nday-view: the allDayEventTemplate option was removed from the day view. To migrate use the eventTemplate input and check if dayEvent.event.allDay is set in the template\nWeek view events will now appear on the bottom time grid. To restore the old behaviour you can set allDay: true on the event to make it appear at the top. \n\nPeople extending the CalendarWeekViewComponent will probably have to adjust their child component as the template and internal component api has changed significantly.\n\nmonth-view: If using a custom openDayEventsTemplate for the month view you must now wrap your template with:\n\nand then you must add the collapse animation to the component that contains the open day events :\nimport { collapseAnimation } from 'angular-calendar';\n\n// add this to your component metadata\nanimations: [collapseAnimation]\ntooltip: all tooltips now default to auto positioning, you can use the tooltipPlacement input on all components to override this behaviour though\nevent-clicked: eventClicked now fires whenever the event container instead of the event title is clicked\nday-view: previously events with no end date that were resized would emit an empty end time, now they will emit a sensible default new end date\nresizable: only one event at a time can now be resized on the day or week views\nweek-view: if you were extending the week view component then the internal API has changed slightly and you may need to adjust your app\nmonth-view: Custom template users will now need to add a \"dragActiveClass='cal-drag-active'\" anywhere they use an mwlDraggable directive\n\nIf using the mwlDraggable directive anywhere else in your app you will need to apply pointer-events: none to the element yourself when it's being dragged. This can be done with the dragActiveClass option\n\nday-view: if you were extending the day view component then the internal API has changed slightly and you may need to adjust your app\ndeep module imports angular-calendar/modules/{common,month,week,day} are no longer supported as the package is now treeshakable. To migrate, adjust your imports to be from angular-calendar directly\nmoment: the moment weekViewColumnSubHeader format has changed for consistency with the other date formatters\nthere were some minor breaking changes in the drag and drop library that might affect your app if you were using it outside of the calendar. See the changelog for more info: https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-draggable-droppable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\nweek-view: events with no end date that are resized now assume to have the start date as the end date\n\n\n0.25.2 (2018-05-12)\nBug Fixes\n\nproperly mark styles as having side effects (625e586)\n\n\n0.25.1 (2018-05-11)\nBug Fixes\n\nmark styles as having side effects (2667433)\n\n\n0.25.0 (2018-05-11)\nFeatures\n\nupgrade to angular 6 (71091ab), closes #512\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nangular 6 or higher is now required to use this package\n\n\n0.24.1 (2018-05-09)\nBug Fixes\n\nday-view: prevent selection when dragging cal-event (#521) (f799bf5), closes #522\n\n\n0.24.0 (2018-04-17)\nBug Fixes\n\nuse the browsers timezone in the angular date formatter (41fa40b), closes #502\n\nFeatures\n\nmake event colors optional (4f9ed24), closes #468\n\n\n0.23.7 (2018-03-15)\nBug Fixes\n\nday-view: refresh the view when hourSegments changes (f99a07b), closes #470\n\n\n0.23.6 (2018-02-12)\nBug Fixes\n\nfix partial module imports (8540a28), closes #461\n\n\n0.23.5 (2018-02-11)\nBug Fixes\n\nmonth-view: expose the day the event was dropped on (6aeb550), closes #443\n\n\n0.23.4 (2018-02-11)\nBug Fixes\n\nday-view: fix scrolling on an ipad (b5955ae), closes #458\n\n\n0.23.3 (2018-01-29)\nPerformance Improvements\n\ntrack-by: use track by on all ngFor elements (aebe832), closes #444\n\n\n0.23.2 (2018-01-10)\nBug Fixes\n\nweek-view: ensure event span is correct in some edge cases (8b8adef), closes #432\n\n\n0.23.1 (2018-01-02)\nBug Fixes\n\nrestore compatibility with system.js (1b3c27a)\n\n\n0.23.0 (2018-01-02)\nBug Fixes\n\nuniversal: make the calendar work with universal (again) (8ae8419), closes #408\n\nFeatures\n\ndate-formatter: use the angular date formatter by default (bd68045)\nexport drag+drop and resizable modules for use in custom templates (579a51a), closes #419\nupgrade angular draggable droppable package (fd30c39)\nupgrade angular resizable element (26e2b53)\nupgrade calendar-utils (fe59aad)\nupgrade to angular 5 (775a62e), closes #417\nuse ng-packagr for bundling the package (5744e9b), closes #408\nday-view: expose the period on the beforeViewRender output (24739ce), closes #418\nmonth-view: call beforeViewRender with the view period (a9ab6d9), closes #418\nweek-view: expose the view period on beforeViewRender (cb73eff), closes #418\n\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nangular 5 or higher is now required to use this package\nif using a locale other than english you will need to import the appropriate locale data somewhere in your app:\n`\nimport { registerLocaleData } from '@angular/common';\nimport localeFr from '@angular/common/locales/fr'; // to register french\n\nregisterLocaleData(localeFr);\n* **date-formatter:** the angular date formatter is now used by default to format dates instead of the formatter that requires the Intl polyfill\n* **day-view:** the event signature of the beforeViewRender output has changed from $event.body to $event.body.hourGrid\n* **week-view:** for people extending the root week view component, eventRows is now named view.eventRows\n* the getWeekView function return signature has changed from an array of event rows to an object with the eventRows property set to the previous arrat value.

System.js users will need to update their config accordingly.\n\nAlso the dragStart output was renamed to dragPointerDown. Users using a custom template for the root day or week view components will need to adjust their templates accordingly.\n* The UMD entry point for the `angular-resizable-element` package has changed from `angular-resizable-element/dist/umd/angular-resizable-element.js` to `angular-resizable-element/bundles/angular-resizable-element.umd.js`. System.js users will need to update their config accordingly.\n* System.js users will now need to add an entry for the `positioning` package to their config `'positioning':

The successor of angular-bootstrap-calendar.\nGetting started\nFirst install through npm:\nnpm install --save angular-calendar date-fnsNext include the CSS file in the global (not component scoped) styles of your app:\n/* angular-cli file: src/styles.css */\n@import \"../node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css\";Finally import the calendar module into your apps module:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { CalendarModule, DateAdapter } from 'angular-calendar';\nimport { adapterFactory } from 'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    CalendarModule.forRoot({\n      provide: DateAdapter,\n      useFactory: adapterFactory\n    })\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}In order to allow the most flexibility for all users there is a substantial amount of boilerplate required to get up and running. Please see the demos list for a series of comprehensive examples of how to use this library within your application.\nOnce you are up and running, to access a full list of options for each component, the individual APIs are documented here: mwl-calendar-month-view, mwl-calendar-week-view and mwl-calendar-day-view.\nModule bundlers\nYou can find quick start examples for all common module bundlers in the build-tool-examples folder.\nDocumentation\nTo see all available API options, take a look at the auto generated documentation. You may find it helpful to view the examples on the demo page.\nBreaking changes\nWhere possible this library will strictly adhere to semver and only introduce API breaking changes in 0.x releases or new major versions post 1.0. The only exception to this is if you are using custom templates or extending the base components to add additional functionality, whereby critical bug fixes may introduce breakages as the internal API changes.\nFAQ\nIs this library AoT and universal compatible?\nYes.\nWhat major versions of angular does this library support?\n\n\n\nAngular major\nLast supported angular-calendar version\n\n\n\n\n5.x\n0.24.1\n\n\n4.x\n0.22.3\n\n\n2.x\n0.9.1\n\n\n\nHow do I use this with my favourite module bundler?\nSee the examples list.\nNo styles are appearing?\nNo component styles are included with each component to make it easier to override them (otherwise you’d have to use !important on every rule that you customised). Thus you need to import the CSS file separately from node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css.\nHow come there are so many dependencies?\nWhen building the calendar some parts were found to be reusable so they were split out into their own modules. Only the bare minimum that is required is included with the calendar, there is no extra code than if there were no dependencies. date-fns especially only imports directly the functions it needs and not the entire library.\nThe month, week or day view doesn’t meet my project requirements, but the other views do.\nBuild your own component to replace that view, and use it in place of the one this library provides. It’s impossible to provide a calendar component that meets everyones use cases, hopefully though at least some of the day / week / month view components provided can be customised with the calendars API enough to be of some use to most projects.\nHow come there’s no year view like the ng1 version?\nAs there are so many events to show on each month, it doesn’t provide a lot of value and is just an extra burden to maintain. There is nothing to stop someone from building a new lib like angular-calendar-year-view though ;)\nDoes this calendar work with mobile?\nThis library is not optimised for mobile. Due to the complex nature of a calendar component, it is non trivial to build a calendar that has a great UX on both desktop and mobile. It is recommended to build your own calendar component for mobile that has a dedicated UX. You may be able to get some degree of mobile support by setting some custom CSS rules for smaller screens and including hammerjs but your mileage may vary.\nHow do I use a custom template?\nAll parts of this calendar can be customised via the use of an ng-template. The recipe for applying one is as follows:\n\nFind the template you would like to customise for the month, week or day view component. You can find all available custom templates by reading the documentation for each component. For this example we will pick the cellTemplate from the month view.\nNext find the corresponding child component that will render the template by viewing the source. For our example of the month view cell it is this component\nNow copy the template source for your chosen template into your own component and modify as your see fit.\nFinally pass the template to the components input: \nYou can see an e2e working example of this here\n\nWhat is the browser compatibility?\nAll browsers supported by angular, apart from IE9 as it doesn't support flexbox.\nAngular 1 version\nhttps://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-bootstrap-calendar\nDevelopment\nPrepare your environment\n\nInstall Node.js and NPM (should come with)\nInstall local dev dependencies: npm install while current directory is this repo\n\nDevelopment server\nRun npm start to start a development server on port 8000 with auto reload + tests.\nTesting\nRun npm test to run tests once or npm run test:watch to continually run tests.\nRelease\n\nBump the version in package.json (once the module hits 1.0 this will become automatic)\n\nnpm run releaseLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2018 Matt Lewis\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
